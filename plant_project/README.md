# Plant Growth Analysis from Images

This project provides a simple AI-assisted workflow to analyze plant growth using time-series images.

It automatically extracts plant information from photos and generates growth and health trends over time.

## What Can This Code Do?

The script analyzes plant images and can:

- Measure plant growth area over time
- Estimate plant health condition using color analysis
- Generate growth curves automatically
- Export results for research analysis
- Support long-term plant monitoring

The method works best when photos are taken from 
- the same angle over time
- Background is stable

---

## How It Works

The script performs:

- Automatic Area Measurement
- Automatic Height Measurement
- Automatic Density Measurement
- Automatic Health Index Calculation
- Automatic Anomaly Detection
- Automatic Trend Prediction
- Research Data Export/Output

---

## Requirements

Install Python libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

## How to Run

Inside the project folder:

```bash
python analyze.py
```
