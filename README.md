## Automated acquisition of fruit tree growth data

## Project Background and Motivation
The analysis of fruit tree growth data is essential for understanding plant physiology, growth dynamics, and phenological development. Such data can also be used to parameterize mathematical and data-driven models of fruit tree growth.

However, collecting plant growth data at short time intervals (e.g., daily) in field conditions is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to inconsistency. Manual measurements and observations are often impractical over long growing seasons.

To address these challenges, this project aims to develop an automated monitoring system capable of continuously collecting image-based and environmental data from fruit trees in the field. By automating data acquisition, the system can provide high-frequency, consistent datasets suitable for subsequent quantitative analysis and modeling.
